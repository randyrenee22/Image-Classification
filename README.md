# Image-Classification
Image Classification problem that was assigned during my time in Graduate School.

This assignment was given to me during my Big Data and Machine Learning course during my time in graduate school.
We were tasked with using different machine learning methodologies to provide the best accuracy percentage in terms of this specific image classification.

I attempted different approaches such as SVM and ANN.
We were only given a few days to complete the task, so a high accuracy percentage was not expected.

I noted my thought process and provided comments as thoroughly as I could at the time.
Additionally, the necessary files used are also provided.
Please note, however, that the file containing the training images was too large to upload to Git.
